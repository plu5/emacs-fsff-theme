This theme is meant for windowed emacs and looks bad in ~-nw~. Therefore, by default, the faces are only applied in graphic displays. You can set the variable ~fsff-display-class~ to change this behaviour.

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/directory/containing/theme/")
  (load-theme 'fsff t)
#+END_SRC
Alternatively you can place it in folders already in the ~custom-theme-load-path~, like ~custom-theme-directory~ or the folder ~themes~ in ~data-directory~ (for me it is ~/usr/share/emacs/<version>/etc/themes/~).

** Suggested customisation
I suggest you set ~org-src-block-faces~ variable, e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-block-faces '(("emacs-lisp" (:foreground "grey30"))
                              ("python" (:foreground "grey30"))
                              ("bash" (:foreground "grey30"))))
#+END_SRC
this will determine the face of the normal text in org source blocks. Otherwise the face used is ~org-block~ which I have set to inherit ~shadow~.

And I should mention that for highlighting you need to set
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
#+END_SRC
